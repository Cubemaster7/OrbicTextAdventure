Orbic Legacy is a text adventure being developed in Python. 
The game is currently in a very early state, so most features have not been implemented. 
The game will feature a large story that ties in with Orbic's Story, another game releasing on Unity. 
The story takes place about 100 years after Orbic's Story, but they can be played in either order.
